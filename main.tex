\section{ABSTRACT}
As it is, the living spaces of modern college students are not that big. Dorms and apartments alike are created with the intent of housing as many students as possible in as small of a space as possible. This creates an obstacle for students when it comes to the types of recreational activities they are able to pursue in these small spaces. Inspired by the basketball-shooting games found in arcades, we have decided to create a scaled-down version that will allow college students to practice their basketball-shooting skills in a confined environment. This game will also help foster friendly competition among students and will provide a chance for them to gather together. 

Our basketball-shooting game will display many of the same features found on the commercial games found in arcades. To accomplish this, we will be using the Circuit Playground Express circuit board and its array of sensors. Firstly, we will be design the physical court using inexpensive materials such as cardboard and plastic. We will then use the CPX board's light sensor, which will be mounted on the backboard, to detect when a ball is passed through the hoop. We will also create a program to display the time remaining on the game as well as the current score. Upon a successful shot, the user's score will increment, and this will repeat until the timer runs out. We will also utilize the LED lights on the CPX board to create a visual effect whenever a shot is made. With all of these features implemented, we will have created a fun game that college students can utilize in their small living spaces.

\section{INTRODUCTION}
In this project, our team will use our programming skills learned in AERE 361 along with the Adafruit Circuit Playground Express to create an arcade-like mini basketball game. Our team, Team Daedalus consists of members, Andrew Finfrock, Ricardo Herrera, Otis Miller, James White, and Yolanda Zhang. We are all upperclassmen majoring in aerospace engineering at Iowa State University and we are currently taking the Advanced Programming for Aerospace class, AERE 361. 

For this project, we wanted to create a fun, portable, simple game that could be played in small spaces yet still be entertaining. We wanted a game that could be used for stress relief as a quick study break, or as a friendly competition when hanging out with friends. With this criteria in mind, we landed on the idea to make an arcade-like mini basketball game, perfect for this project with the added bonus of improving one's hand-eye coordination. 

\section{FEATURES}
The key feature of our project will be its ability to detect a ball as it goes through a basketball net. Using the light detector on the CPX board, which will be mounted on the backboard of the basketball net, we will be able to see when an object has been passed through the hoop. Once an object passes through, it will create a momentary period of darkness, which will be picked up by the light sensor. 
    
Another feature of our game will be its ability to count score according to game mode rules. Our game will also feature multiple different modes in which certain basketball shots will be worth different point values. Our game will be able to keep track of this to create different sets of challenges for the user(s). 
 
Finally, our game will also feature the ability to switch game modes with a human machine interface. As mentioned before, the different modes will create sets of challenges for the player(s), and will even feature single player and multiplayer modes. This will allow the game to be tailored to the liking of the player(s). This customization will add to the uniqueness of our game. 


\section{PROBLEM STATEMENT}
College life is something that all of us here at Iowa State adjust to. The freedoms you gain hand in hand with the responsibilities you must bear. The freedom to make your own schedule comes with the responsiblity to manage your own time. The freedom of choice means you need to choose wisely. With mental health issues on the rise, we can view this as a major stressor that will be placed on the entire student body. Acording to The National College Health Assessment performed in fall of 2021, almost 45 percent of students are impacted by stress, and another 35.59 percent deal with anxiety realated issues. Therefore we should look into combatting these ailments, and one of the best ways listed by the Anxiety and Depression Association of America is exercise, or really any physical activity.

So what is keeping student's from being active? Perhaps its because they don't have enough space to be active? Unlikely, with all the gyms, open areas, and clubs that offer dozzens of opertunities to be active. But, as far as personal space goes, students can be quite limited while living in dorms. So the size of student's personal lives has been impacted without thinking about how they will likely share this space with at least one roommate. Typical stress and anxiety reducing activities may need to be hidden or at least less noticable as to maintain some kind of privacy for the students. Otherwise, they may not be comfortable to do said anxiety combatting activities for fear of being seen as abnormal. So, we need to find some way to keep students somewhat physically active while constrained to their smaller spaces.

\section{PROBLEM SOLUTION}
The solution to this problem we have decided on pursuing is a game to be played as a healthy interruption for study breaks and general recreation. The game will be similar to basketball involving tossing a ball through a hoop to gather score. Much like the basketball games found in arcades. Though we will be building a portable compact version, for use in college dorms and on campus.

To achieve this we will be using the Adafruit Circuit Playground and a light sensor. We will build a structure that will house the electronics and act as the hoop for the basketball game. The light sensor will be mounted in a position beneath the hoop to detect if the ball thrown by a player enters the hoop because it will break the beam and send a different signal back to the Circuit Playground. The physical hoop structure itself will be responsible for ensuring the beam will only break if the ball enters the hoop. The software we will develop will then use this signal to tally score during a timed interval when the game is started. We will also be changing how score and time is recorded and set depending on some different game modes we will develop once we have a simple functional prototype.

With the final product the user should be able to select a game mode with the buttons on the Circuit Playground. Then during a timed interval the product will tally how many times the ball goes through the hoop and then give the total back once time is up.

\section{CONCLUSION}
With small living spaces, it can be difficult for college students to find a form of friendly completion that doesn't lie within video games. Our proposition to this challenge is to create a scaled-down basketball-shooting game using a CPX circuit board. The multitude of sensors and LED lights on the build will allow us to create a functional game that can provide students with entertainment and competition among their peers.
